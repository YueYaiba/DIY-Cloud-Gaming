# Hardware

### You basically need 4 things to make this work.

• Your computer  
• Your android device  
• A Raspberry Pi (Refer to the relevant section for which models work)  
• A router with port forwarding  


# Setting Up Lan Cloud Gaming

## Computer Software

### Nvidia

You can download and use [Geforce Experience](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Setup-Guide)  

### Nvidia, AMD and Intel

I recommend this option as I find it to be the simplest and fastest to setup, simply download and install [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)  

## Android Software

Install [Moonlight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limelight) from the Google Play Store.  
Install [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases), just download and install the universal apk for the latest stable release.  
Install [Termux-Widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases) do NOT download any termux stuff from the Google Play Store, those apps are not updated anymore.
